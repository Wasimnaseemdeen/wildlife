       As of my last knowledge update in January 2022,
       Sri Lanka is not known to have a significant population of leopards. 
       However, leopards are found in various national parks and wildlife reserves in the country.
       Please note that the status and distribution of wildlife can change, 
       and it's always a good idea to refer to the latest information from wildlife authorities for the most accurate details.
       Here are three well-known venues where leopards have been observed in Sri Lanka:<br>


<h2>Yala National Park:<h2>
    <img src="/download (3).jfif" alt="Yala National Park"><br>

Yala National Park is one of the most popular and well-known wildlife reserves in Sri Lanka.
It is located in the southeast part of the country.
The park is renowned for its diverse range of wildlife, 
including leopards. Yala has one of the highest leopard densities in the world.
Visitors to Yala National Park have a good chance of spotting leopards,
especially during the early morning or late afternoon safari drives.

   <h3> Wilpattu National Park:</h3>
   <img src="/284px-WilpattuNationalPark-April2014_(3).jfif" alt="Wilpattu NAtional Park"><br>


Wilpattu is the largest national park in Sri Lanka and is located in the northwest part of the country.
It is known for its unique landscape, which includes natural lakes known as "villus" and dense vegetation,
providing a suitable habitat for leopards.
Wilpattu National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, 
and leopards can be spotted during safari tours.

    <h4>Udawalawe National Park:</h4>
    <img src="/gettyimages-1178702408-612x612.jpg" alt="Udawalawe National Park" style="width: 40%;height: 40%;"><br>

Udawalawe is located in the southern part of Sri Lanka and is known for its population of Asian elephants. 
While elephants are the main attraction, the park also supports a variety of other wildlife, including leopards.
The park's open grasslands and reservoirs provide opportunities for wildlife observation,
and leopards are occasionally spotted by visitors.
Remember to check with local authorities or official park websites for the most up-to-date information on leopard sightings and conservation efforts.
Additionally, conservation measures are crucial to ensure the protection and sustainability of leopard populations in Sri Lanka.<br>

    <h5 align="left">Threat To Lepords:</h5>
    

   * Leopards in Sri Lanka confront various threats that jeopardize their existence in the wild.<br>
   * Habitat loss and fragmentation pose significant challenges as urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development encroach upon their natural territories.<br>
   * Human-leopard conflict is another pressing issue, often resulting in retaliatory killings by local communities due to livestock depredation or perceived threats to human safety.<br>
   * Poaching and illegal wildlife trade also contribute to the decline of leopard populations, with their body parts sought after for traditional medicine and as trophies.<br>
   * Inadequate conservation measures and insufficient protection of wildlife habitats exacerbate these issues. <br>
   * Addressing these threats requires a comprehensive approach, including habitat preservation, community-based conservation initiatives,<br> 
   * And robust law enforcement to combat illegal activities and ensure the long-term survival of leopards in Sri Lanka.<br> 
   * Conservation awareness and education are crucial components in fostering coexistence between leopards and local communities while promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.<br>
    
  Consequences:<br>
  1.Population Decline
  Direct threats such as poaching,
  habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict can lead to a significant decline in leopard populations.
  Reductions in population size can disrupt the balance of ecosystems, 
  as leopards play a crucial role in controlling prey populations.<br>

  2.Genetic Diversity Loss:

  As populations decrease, there is a higher risk of inbreeding, which can result in a loss of genetic diversity.
  Reduced genetic diversity can make the species more vulnerable to diseases and environmental changes, 
  potentially compromising its long-term survival.<br>

  3.Ecological Imbalance:

Leopards are apex predators, and their presence helps regulate prey populations.
A decline in leopard numbers can lead to an increase in the populations of prey species, which, in turn, can affect vegetation and the overall structure of ecosystems.
This imbalance may have cascading effects throughout the food web.<br>
 
 4.Increased Human-Wildlife Conflict:

Habitat loss and fragmentation can bring leopards into closer contact with human settlements.
This proximity often results in conflicts, with leopards preying on livestock, and, in some cases, posing threats to human safety.
Retaliatory killings by humans further exacerbate the conflict.
